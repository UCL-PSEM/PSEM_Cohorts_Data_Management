# The location of your QCed ALSPAC data in BGEN format
# Where you want the extracted SNPs to be exported
# The path location of the SNP list 

ALSPAC_QC="/path/to/ALSPAC/data/"

#### Default output directories are originally commented out 
# However, the '#' can be removed and a path for a default output directory and snp list can be included

#out_dir="/Path/to/default/output/directory/"
